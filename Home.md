# ATLAS
ATLAS is a free, publicly available web-based, open-source software application developed by the OHDSI community to support the design and execution of observational analyses to generate real world evidence from patient level observational data. Atlas is an open science analytics platform that can be installed locally within your institution to perform analyses across one or more observational databases which have been standardized to the [OMOP Common Data Model V5](https://github.com/OHDSI/CommonDataModel) and can facilitate exchange of analysis designs with any other organizations across the OHDSI community who have adopted the
same open science community standards and tools.
